myComplex class; calling add function after / before defining the new complex number
matrix D.C meaning dot product -->

<!-- In qn3, to find B.C, it is not conventional matrix opration, more like, if two vectors are given as column matrix, a new operation has to defined to do the dot product. -->

<!-- shouldI put all my code in the library even while I am doing a specifiv cquestion -->

<!-- FOr input files, can you show me some examples
Can i use an input from the py file by imprting it(thus running the initializations) (Will add commentf for understanding what is what) -->

generalizing parsing

# Gauss- Jordon linear solve

<!-- as function, should the output be column matrix - yes -->

# Random walks

<!-- different seeds for diffferent axes - np

Can I attach the text output at the end of code as comments - Y
and figures as files
(if large data output is specified, those will be txt/dat file)

can the seeds for diff walk be fixed beforehand or random - Fixed

why exactly we added to the previous coordinates _to localize random walk from current point in a defined step range -->

# LU decomposition

forward backward substitution cannot be same for the LU and cholesky decomposition, so separate code?

where else was positive definite important

Cholesky needs det!=0 =, use what for it

LU condition only leading submatrix?
said that if matrix itself is invertible, pivot and do it.

<!-- LU determinant is (-1)^n times?? -->

# iterative method



# roots

<!-- shifting a when shfting b . -->

<!-- floating point precision -->

# laguerre

<!-- sign in denominator algo - discuss
