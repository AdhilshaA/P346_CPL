<!-- start term in ap gp hp
decimals in the hp sum

input file and output one for each question
output file format
myComplex class; calling add function after / before defining the new complex number
matrix D.C meaning dot product -->

<!-- In qn3, to find B.C, it is not conventional matrix opration, more like, if two vectors are given as column matrix, a new operation has to defined to do the dot product. -->

<!-- shouldI put all my code in the library even while I am doing a specifiv cquestion -->

<!-- FOr input files, can you show me some examples
Can i use an input from the py file by imprting it(thus running the initializations) (Will add commentf for understanding what is what) -->

generalizing parsing

is ipynb file uploaded in th egithub preferred over github py files
(it has all outputs preprintd, but inputs cannot be read from another file)

writing and reading formats of the input files we need

# Gauss- Jordon linear solve

<!-- as function, should the output be column matrix - yes -->

# Random walks

<!-- different seeds for diffferent axes - np

Can I attach the text output at the end of code as comments - Y
and figures as files
(if large data output is specified, those will be txt/dat file)

can the seeds for diff walk be fixed beforehand or random - Fixed

why exactly we added to the previous coordinates _to localize random walk from current point in a defined step range -->

# LU decomposition

forward backward substitution cannot be same for the LU and cholesky decomposition, so separate code?
