myComplex class; calling add function after / before defining the new complex number
matrix D.C meaning dot product -->

In mycomplex class, should the functions be just functions or a class funcctions (called by/on the variables of the class)

In qn3, to find B.C, it is not conventional matrix opration, more like, if two vectors are given as column matrix, a new operation has to defined to do the dot product.

# Gauss- Jordon linear solve

<!-- as function, should the output be column matrix - yes -->

# Random walks

<!-- different seeds for diffferent axes - np

Can I attach the text output at the end of code as comments - Y
and figures as files
(if large data output is specified, those will be txt/dat file)

can the seeds for diff walk be fixed beforehand or random - Fixed

why exactly we added to the previous coordinates _to localize random walk from current point in a defined step range -->
